# About Me 
My name is Michael Algarra, a Biomedical Engineering graduate with a concentration in Bioinformatics from Drexel University.  
I’m interested in Bioinformatics and Data Analytics. Specifically I enjoy programming with statistics and data mining.
I'm currently working at Merck & Co. as a Data Scientist, and attending the University of Pennsylvania online for a masters in Data Science.
I’m looking to collaborate on working with Biological Data including DNA NGS data, Statistical analyses on data, and working with complex Major League Baseball Team data.
