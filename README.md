I’m @MichaelAlgarra ,
I’m interested in Bioinformatics and Data Analytics. Specifically I enjoy programming with statistics and data mining. 
I’m currently learning how to analyze genetic biological data, as well as learning how to apply statistics in programming.
I’m looking to collaborate on developing Sesame, and ocassionally working with DNA methylation data.
